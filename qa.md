Part 2: Test Case Design
Functional Test Cases
User Registration
Verify a user can successfully register with valid information.
Confirm error messages are displayed for invalid registration data.
Check the uniqueness of user emails during registration.
Product Search
Validate the search functionality returns relevant results.
Confirm the search bar handles empty queries gracefully.
Test search filters to ensure accurate product categorization.
Cart Management
Verify items can be added to the cart from the product page.
Confirm the correct quantity and price are displayed in the cart.
Test the removal of items from the cart.
Checkout Process
Validate a user can proceed through the checkout process successfully.
Confirm error messages are displayed for incomplete or incorrect information.
Test various payment methods for successful transactions.
Order Management
Verify users can view their order history.
Confirm order details are accurate and displayed correctly.
Test the cancellation of orders.
Edge and Boundary Test Cases
Test the minimum and maximum character limits for user registration fields.
Verify the system behavior when the cart is empty or has a large number of items.
Test the system's response when searching for products with extremely long names.
Part 3: Test Automation
Test Automation Framework
Chosen Framework: Selenium WebDriver with Java

Reasons:

Selenium is widely adopted for web automation.
Strong community support and extensive documentation.
Compatibility with multiple browsers and platforms.
Framework Architecture Overview:

Page Object Model (POM) for better code organization.
JUnit for test execution and reporting.
Automated Test Scripts
Automated scripts cover three critical scenarios:

User Registration:

Automates the registration process with valid data.
Verifies error messages for invalid data.
Product Search:

Automates product search with valid queries.
Tests the behavior for empty queries.
Cart Management:

Automates adding items to the cart.
Verifies correct quantity and price display.
Tests item removal from the cart.
Test Data Management
Test data is managed within the automated scripts using a combination of predefined data and dynamic data generation. For example, email addresses during user registration are dynamically generated to ensure uniqueness.
